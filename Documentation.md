 Wep App sarts with a page where user selects between 2 ways of search by title or imdb id, through two collapsible accordion fields.

 By hitting Search button leads him to a 

 1) list page if searches by title
 2) into movie details page if searches by id.

 List is expandable till the end of all found results and displays basic info about the movies and series found on this title. 
 (checks if index number reaches the total results number of the response and if not, requests each time next page of results)

 Surely the App needed a great improvement in UI, which I consider "primitive" for my standard and surely with more css animations to "play with user's eye".
 Also faced a bit difficulty in usage of router which didn't let me complete the navigation to the movie details from list.

 But a change of plans in my calendar just "ate" a day from my implementation and couldn't replace it as I wanted.
